\section{Motivation}
With the Ethereum network launched in 2015 decentralized finance started its triumphal procession in 2017 with the first few implemented use cases for Ethereum. Since 2020 these use cases concentrated on more useful and actual reasonable projects (Beispiel pls, vielleicht eins der frühen 2021er). However, these projects are predestinated for more improvement and have even more potential for appending applications. Optimizer play a major role in the derivative of such and is main object of this thesis. 
(Vielleicht eigenes Yieldfarming thematisieren und als Eigenmotivation angeben, vllt auch als Anlass für den Optimizer) We would like to create an optimizer for the pancakeswap finance platform that auto-compunded and auto-staked the existing syrup pools on the platform. We want to archive an improvement for the user to save time and money. Striving passive income is a goal for many.
