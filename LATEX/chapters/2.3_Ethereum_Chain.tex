\section{Ethereum Chain}
When Bitcoin established itself for a couple of years it became clear that there is a lot of potential in optimizing the concept of the Bitcoin technology. One projects which tried to archive that in terms of efficienty, scalability and speed was Ethereum which idea arises in 2013. After a developing span of nearly two years Ethereum was launched in 2015 and overcomes several problems of the cryptocurrencies known back then. The goal of the Ethereum network was to build a multitool working like a general operating system which can run arbitrary applications written by whoever can program smart contracts~\cite{Vitalik2015}.
In contrast to other known blockchains, Ehtereum implements two types of accounts, user accounts and contract accounts~\cite{buterin2014next}. This made Ethereum the first open ledger peer-to-peer network for deploying and interacting with smart contract code. With the build-in programming language known as Solidity scripting language limitations of Bitcoin were handled and a Turing-completeness was implemented in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)~\cite{Vujicic2018, buterin2014next}.

One of the rather disadvantages of the Ethereum Blockchain not mentioned in the last chapter is that its block producting mechanismn is based on "Proof of Work". Even though the developers are working on the newer Ehtereum 2.0 version currently to implement "Proof-of-Stake" it could be witnessed in the last Crypto Marktet Cycel of 2021 that a lot of people were reliant on lower gas fees.
